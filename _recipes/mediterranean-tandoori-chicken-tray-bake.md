<h1>Mediterranean Tandoori Chicken Tray Bake</h1>
<p>This sheet pan dinner brings together the bold flavors of tandoori spices with fresh Mediterranean vegetables for an effortless low-carb meal. Using jarred tandoori paste makes this incredibly convenient while still delivering authentic taste.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 boneless chicken thighs (or breasts, skin-on or skinless)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons tandoori paste (from a jar - I recommend Patak's or similar)</li>
<li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
<li>1 medium zucchini, cut into thick rounds</li>
<li>1 red bell pepper, cut into large chunks</li>
<li>1 cup cauliflower florets (or use broccoli)</li>
<li>1 red onion, cut into wedges</li>
<li>8-10 cherry tomatoes</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
<li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
<li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
<li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Marinate (Optional - 5 mins or overnight)</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mix the marinade</strong>: In a large bowl, combine tandoori paste and Greek yogurt. This creates a creamy marinade that keeps the chicken incredibly moist.</li>
<li><strong>Season chicken</strong>: Pat chicken dry and coat with the tandoori yogurt mixture. For best results, marinate 30 minutes or overnight, but even 5-10 minutes works for busy nights.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prepare the Tray</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preheat oven</strong>: Set to 425째F (220째C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.</li>
<li><strong>Season vegetables</strong>: In a large bowl, toss zucchini, bell pepper, cauliflower, and onion with olive oil, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper.</li>
<li><strong>Arrange on tray</strong>: Spread vegetables in a single layer on one side of the baking sheet.</li>
<li><strong>Add chicken</strong>: Place marinated chicken pieces skin-side up (if using skin-on) among the vegetables. Spoon any extra marinade over the chicken.</li>
<li><strong>Add tomatoes</strong>: Scatter cherry tomatoes over the vegetables - they'll roast beautifully and add juicy bursts.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Bake</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>First bake</strong>: Roast for 20 minutes. The high heat helps caramelize the vegetables and creates that lovely char on the chicken.</li>
<li><strong>Toss and finish</strong>: Toss vegetables gently, then return to oven for 10-15 minutes more, until chicken reaches 165째F (74째C) internal temperature and vegetables are tender.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Serve</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Garnish</strong>: Remove from oven and let rest 5 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh cilantro.</li>
<li><strong>Serve</strong>: Serve with extra lemon wedges for squeezing over the top. The charred edges and creamy yogurt-marinated chicken make this incredibly satisfying.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Low-Carb Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vegetable swaps</strong>: Feel free to swap in eggplant cubes, bell peppers, or mushrooms - all are low-carb friendly</li>
<li><strong>Serve over</strong>: Instead of rice, try serving over cauliflower rice or with a simple green salad</li>
<li><strong>Leftovers</strong>: This reheats beautifully and works great for meal prep</li>
</ul>
<h2>Convenience Hacks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prep ahead</strong>: The vegetables can be prepped up to 2 days ahead</li>
<li><strong>Marinade shortcut</strong>: If you're really pressed for time, just brush the chicken with tandoori paste straight from the jar - still delicious!</li>
<li><strong>Double batch</strong>: Make twice as much and use leftovers in salads or wraps</li>
