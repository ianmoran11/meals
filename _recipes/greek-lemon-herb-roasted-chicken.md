title: Greek Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken
---

<p>This Greek-style roasted chicken brings the authentic flavors of the Mediterranean to your table. The combination of lemon, garlic, and fresh herbs creates a bright, aromatic dish that's naturally low in carbohydrates but rich in Mediterranean flavors. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and roasted to golden perfection, with crispy skin and incredibly juicy meat.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean herbs - oregano, thyme, and rosemary - aren't just flavorful; they're also packed with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties typical of the Mediterranean diet. This dish exemplifies how Mediterranean cooking creates maximum flavor with healthy, simple ingredients.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 425째F (220째C). Remove chicken from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare</strong> the herb mixture: In a small bowl, combine lemon juice, zest, garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary, olive oil, salt, and pepper to create a paste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pat</strong> the chicken dry with paper towels. This ensures crispy skin. Rub the herb mixture all over the chicken, including under the skin on the breast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stuff</strong> the chicken cavity with lemon slices and quartered onion. These aromatics will infuse the chicken from the inside while roasting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Truss</strong> the chicken legs together with kitchen twine to promote even cooking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Roast</strong> the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan for approximately 75 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C) in the thickest part of the thigh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rest</strong> the chicken for 15 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Serve</strong> with roasted low-carb vegetables or a fresh Greek salad for a complete Mediterranean meal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Chef's Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crispy Skin Trick</strong>: Let the chicken air-dry in the refrigerator uncovered for a few hours before roasting for extra crispy skin.</li>
<li><strong>Herb Variations</strong>: Add fresh basil or marjoram for different Mediterranean herb profiles.</li>
<li><strong>Make-Ahead</strong>: Prepare the herb rub up to 2 days in advance for deeper flavor penetration.</li>
<li><strong>Leftover Magic</strong>: Use leftover chicken in Mediterranean salads, lettuce wraps, or cauliflower rice bowls.</li>
</ul>
