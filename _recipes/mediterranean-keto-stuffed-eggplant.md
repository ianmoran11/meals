<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Prepare the Eggplant</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preheat oven</strong>: Set to 400°F (200°C).</li>
<li><strong>Score eggplant</strong>: Cut eggplants in half lengthwise. Score the flesh in a crosshatch pattern, being careful not to pierce the skin.</li>
<li><strong>Season and oil</strong>: Brush cut sides with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li><strong>Roast</strong>: Place cut-side down on a baking sheet and roast for 25 minutes until tender.</li>
<li><strong>Scoop flesh</strong>: Let cool slightly, then scoop out the flesh, leaving about 1/2 inch border. Roughly chop the scooped flesh and set aside.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Make the Filling</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cook aromatics</strong>: Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened.</li>
<li><strong>Add garlic</strong>: Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
<li><strong>Brown meat</strong>: Add ground lamb or beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through (about 8 minutes).</li>
<li><strong>Add eggplant</strong>: Stir in the chopped eggplant flesh and cook for 3-4 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Season</strong>: Add drained tomatoes, oregano, basil, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes until flavors meld.</li>
<li><strong>Add cheese</strong>: Remove from heat and stir in half the feta cheese and parsley.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Stuff and Bake</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fill shells</strong>: Divide the meat mixture among the eggplant shells, mounding it slightly.</li>
<li><strong>Top with cheese</strong>: Sprinkle remaining feta and Parmesan cheese over the tops.</li>
<li><strong>Final bake</strong>: Return to oven and bake for 15-20 minutes until cheese is golden and filling is heated through.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Serve</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Garnish</strong>: Sprinkle with remaining parsley and pine nuts if using.</li>
<li><strong>Serve</strong>: Serve hot as a complete meal.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Keto Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meat options</strong>: Ground turkey or chicken work well too, though lamb gives the most authentic flavor</li>
<li><strong>Cheese variations</strong>: Try goat cheese or ricotta instead of feta</li>
<li><strong>Extra vegetables</strong>: Add diced bell peppers or zucchini to the filling</li>
</ul>
<h2>Make-Ahead Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prep ahead</strong>: Eggplant shells and filling can be prepared up to 2 days in advance</li>
<li><strong>Freeze</strong>: Assembled stuffed eggplants freeze well for up to 3 months</li>
<li><strong>Reheat</strong>: Cover with foil and reheat at 350°F until warmed through</li>
