This Greek-style roasted chicken brings the authentic flavors of the Mediterranean to your table. The combination of lemon, garlic, and fresh herbs creates a bright, aromatic dish that's naturally low in carbohydrates but rich in Mediterranean flavors. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and roasted to golden perfection, with crispy skin and incredibly juicy meat.

The Mediterranean herbs - oregano, thyme, and rosemary - aren't just flavorful; they're also packed with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties typical of the Mediterranean diet. This dish exemplifies how Mediterranean cooking creates maximum flavor with healthy, simple ingredients.

## Instructions

1. **Preheat** oven to 425째F (220째C). Remove chicken from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking.

2. **Prepare** the herb mixture: In a small bowl, combine lemon juice, zest, garlic, oregano, thyme, rosemary, olive oil, salt, and pepper to create a paste.

3. **Pat** the chicken dry with paper towels. This ensures crispy skin. Rub the herb mixture all over the chicken, including under the skin on the breast.

4. **Stuff** the chicken cavity with lemon slices and quartered onion. These aromatics will infuse the chicken from the inside while roasting.

5. **Truss** the chicken legs together with kitchen twine to promote even cooking.

6. **Roast** the chicken on a rack in a roasting pan for approximately 75 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C) in the thickest part of the thigh.

7. **Rest** the chicken for 15 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat.

8. **Serve** with roasted low-carb vegetables or a fresh Greek salad for a complete Mediterranean meal.

## Chef's Tips

- **Crispy Skin Trick**: Let the chicken air-dry in the refrigerator uncovered for a few hours before roasting for extra crispy skin.
- **Herb Variations**: Add fresh basil or marjoram for different Mediterranean herb profiles.
- **Make-Ahead**: Prepare the herb rub up to 2 days in advance for deeper flavor penetration.
- **Leftover Magic**: Use leftover chicken in Mediterranean salads, lettuce wraps, or cauliflower rice bowls.
