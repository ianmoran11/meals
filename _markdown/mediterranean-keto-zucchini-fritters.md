# Mediterranean Keto Zucchini Fritters

These crispy, golden fritters are packed with fresh Mediterranean flavors and make a perfect keto-friendly side dish or light meal. The combination of zucchini, herbs, and feta creates a deliciously satisfying bite.

## Ingredients

- 3 medium zucchini, grated (about 4 cups)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 cup olive oil for frying
- Greek yogurt for serving
- Lemon wedges for serving

## Instructions

### Prepare the Zucchini
1. **Grate zucchini**: Using a box grater or food processor, grate the zucchini into a large bowl.
2. **Salt and drain**: Sprinkle grated zucchini with salt and toss well. Let sit for 15 minutes to draw out moisture.
3. **Squeeze dry**: Transfer zucchini to a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth. Squeeze firmly to remove as much liquid as possible - this is crucial for crispy fritters.

### Make the Batter
4. **Combine wet ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together beaten eggs.
5. **Add dry ingredients**: Stir in almond flour, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper until well combined.
6. **Add zucchini and herbs**: Fold in the squeezed zucchini, feta cheese, green onions, dill, parsley, and minced garlic. Mix until evenly distributed.

### Cook the Fritters
7. **Heat oil**: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
8. **Form fritters**: Using a 1/4 cup measure or large spoon, scoop batter and gently flatten into patties about 3 inches wide.
9. **Fry**: Cook fritters for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy. Don't overcrowd the pan - work in batches if necessary.
10. **Drain**: Transfer cooked fritters to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.

### Serve
11. **Serve warm**: Serve immediately while hot and crispy.
12. **Accompaniments**: Serve with a dollop of Greek yogurt and lemon wedges for squeezing.

## Keto Tips

- **Extra crispy**: Make sure to squeeze out as much liquid as possible from the zucchini
- **Cheese variations**: Try goat cheese or ricotta instead of feta
- **Herb swaps**: Use fresh mint, oregano, or basil for different flavor profiles

## Serving Suggestions

- **As a side**: Perfect alongside grilled meats or fish
- **Light meal**: Serve with a Greek salad for a complete meal
- **Appetizer**: Make smaller fritters for party appetizers

## Storage Tips

- **Refrigerate**: Store leftover fritters in the refrigerator for up to 3 days
- **Reheat**: Reheat in a skillet over medium heat to restore crispiness
- **Freeze**: Freeze cooked fritters for up to 1 month
