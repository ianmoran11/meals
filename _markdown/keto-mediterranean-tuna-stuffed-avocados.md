# Keto Mediterranean Tuna Stuffed Avocados

This no-cook meal combines the richness of avocado with a bright Mediterranean tuna salad. It's perfect for a quick lunch or light dinner, packed with healthy fats and protein while keeping carbs minimal.

## Ingredients

- 2 large ripe avocados, halved and pitted
- 2 cans (5 oz each) tuna in olive oil, drained
- 1/4 cup red onion, finely diced
- 1/4 cup cucumber, finely diced
- 2 tablespoons Kalamata olives, chopped
- 2 tablespoons capers, drained
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Cherry tomatoes for garnish (optional)
- Lemon wedges for serving

## Instructions

### Prepare the Avocados
1. **Halve avocados**: Cut avocados in half lengthwise and remove the pit.
2. **Scoop slightly**: Using a spoon, scoop out a little extra avocado flesh to create a larger cavity for the filling. Reserve the scooped avocado.
3. **Season**: Lightly brush or drizzle the avocado halves with lemon juice to prevent browning and add flavor.

### Make the Tuna Salad
4. **Flake tuna**: In a medium bowl, flake the drained tuna with a fork.
5. **Add vegetables**: Add diced red onion, cucumber, olives, and capers to the tuna.
6. **Mix dressing**: In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes.
7. **Combine**: Pour dressing over tuna mixture and add fresh herbs. Mix gently to combine.
8. **Add avocado**: Dice the reserved avocado flesh and fold it into the tuna mixture.
9. **Season**: Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

### Assemble and Serve
10. **Fill avocados**: Generously spoon the tuna mixture into each avocado half, mounding it slightly.
11. **Garnish**: Top with additional herbs and cherry tomato halves if desired.
12. **Serve**: Serve immediately with lemon wedges on the side.

## Serving Suggestions

- **Complete meal**: Serve with a side of mixed greens drizzled with olive oil
- **Appetizer**: Cut each half into smaller portions for party appetizers
- **Wrap alternative**: Use lettuce leaves to wrap the tuna mixture if you prefer

## Keto Tips

- **Quality tuna**: Use tuna packed in olive oil for extra healthy fats
- **Extra fats**: Drizzle with additional olive oil if needed
- **Protein boost**: Add hard-boiled egg pieces to the tuna mixture

## Variations

- **Salmon version**: Replace tuna with canned or smoked salmon
- **Spicy kick**: Add jalape√±os or hot sauce
- **Greek style**: Add crumbled feta cheese to the mixture

## Make-Ahead Tips

- **Tuna salad**: Can be prepared up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated
- **Avocados**: Cut and fill just before serving to prevent browning
- **Meal prep**: Keep components separate and assemble when ready to eat
