## Instructions

1. **Preheat** your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. **Cream butter and sugars**: In a large bowl, beat softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until creamy.

4. **Add eggs and vanilla**: Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla extract.

5. **Combine ingredients**: Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.

6. **Add chocolate chips**: Fold in the chocolate chips.

7. **Form cookies**: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart.

8. **Bake** for 9-11 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges.

9. **Cool** on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

## Notes

- For softer cookies, slightly underbake them and let them finish cooking on the hot baking sheet.
- Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
- Dough can be frozen for up to 3 months.
