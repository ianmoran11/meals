This vibrant salad combines perfectly grilled chicken with crisp vegetables, tangy feta, and briny olives, all tossed in a zesty lemon-herb dressing. It's a complete meal that's both satisfying and keto-friendly.

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken
- 1.5 pounds boneless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

### For the Salad
- 6 cups mixed greens (romaine, spinach, arugula)
- 1 cucumber, diced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and halved

### For the Lemon-Herb Dressing
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions

### Prepare the Chicken
1. **Season chicken**: Pat chicken breasts dry and brush with olive oil. Season both sides with oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
2. **Heat grill or pan**: Preheat grill to medium-high heat or heat a grill pan over medium-high heat.
3. **Cook chicken**: Grill chicken for 6-7 minutes per side until internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
4. **Rest and slice**: Let chicken rest for 5 minutes, then slice into strips.

### Make the Dressing
5. **Whisk dressing**: In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper until well combined.

### Assemble the Salad
6. **Prepare vegetables**: While chicken cooks, prepare all vegetables and place mixed greens in a large serving bowl.
7. **Add toppings**: Top greens with cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, and olives.
8. **Add chicken**: Arrange sliced chicken on top of the salad.
9. **Add cheese**: Sprinkle crumbled feta over everything.

### Serve
10. **Dress salad**: Drizzle dressing over the salad just before serving.
11. **Toss and serve**: Toss gently to combine or serve with dressing on the side.
