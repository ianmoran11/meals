# Mediterranean Baked Cod with Tomato-Olive Topping

This elegant yet simple dish features tender cod fillets topped with a vibrant Mediterranean mixture of tomatoes, olives, and herbs. It's a light, flavorful meal that's perfect for a keto-friendly dinner.

## Ingredients

### For the Cod
- 4 cod fillets (6 oz each), patted dry
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

### For the Mediterranean Topping
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/3 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and chopped
- 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons capers, drained
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For Serving
- Lemon wedges
- Fresh herbs for garnish

## Instructions

### Prepare the Topping
1. **Mix ingredients**: In a medium bowl, combine cherry tomatoes, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and capers.
2. **Add seasonings**: Add olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes. Mix well.
3. **Season**: Add salt and pepper to taste. Let mixture sit while preparing fish.

### Prepare the Fish
4. **Preheat oven**: Set to 400°F (200°C).
5. **Prepare baking dish**: Lightly oil a baking dish large enough to hold all fillets in a single layer.
6. **Season cod**: Pat cod fillets dry with paper towels. Brush both sides with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
7. **Arrange fish**: Place cod fillets in the prepared baking dish.

### Bake
8. **Add topping**: Spoon the Mediterranean mixture evenly over each cod fillet.
9. **Bake**: Place in oven and bake for 18-20 minutes, until fish flakes easily with a fork and reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C).
10. **Rest**: Remove from oven and let rest for 2-3 minutes.

### Serve
11. **Garnish**: Sprinkle with fresh parsley.
12. **Serve**: Serve immediately with lemon wedges and any pan juices spooned over the top.

## Keto Tips

- **Fish alternatives**: This topping works great with halibut, sea bass, or salmon
- **Extra fats**: Drizzle with additional olive oil before serving
- **Side dishes**: Serve with cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles

## Cooking Tips

- **Fresh vs frozen**: If using frozen cod, thaw completely and pat very dry
- **Don't overcook**: Cod can become dry if overcooked - check at 15 minutes
- **Topping variation**: Add crumbled feta cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking

## Make-Ahead Tips

- **Topping**: Can be prepared up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated
- **Quick dinner**: Keep frozen cod on hand for easy weeknight meals
- **Leftovers**: Gently reheat in a 325°F oven covered with foil
