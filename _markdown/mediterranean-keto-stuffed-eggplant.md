# Mediterranean Keto Stuffed Eggplant

This hearty dish features tender roasted eggplant shells filled with a flavorful mixture of seasoned ground meat, herbs, and cheese. It's a complete keto-friendly meal that captures the essence of Mediterranean cuisine.

## Ingredients

- 2 large eggplants, halved lengthwise
- 1 pound ground lamb or beef (85/15 lean)
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes, drained
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons pine nuts for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

### Prepare the Eggplant
1. **Preheat oven**: Set to 400°F (200°C).
2. **Score eggplant**: Cut eggplants in half lengthwise. Score the flesh in a crosshatch pattern, being careful not to pierce the skin.
3. **Season and oil**: Brush cut sides with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
4. **Roast**: Place cut-side down on a baking sheet and roast for 25 minutes until tender.
5. **Scoop flesh**: Let cool slightly, then scoop out the flesh, leaving about 1/2 inch border. Roughly chop the scooped flesh and set aside.

### Make the Filling
6. **Cook aromatics**: Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened.
7. **Add garlic**: Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
8. **Brown meat**: Add ground lamb or beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through (about 8 minutes).
9. **Add eggplant**: Stir in the chopped eggplant flesh and cook for 3-4 minutes.
10. **Season**: Add drained tomatoes, oregano, basil, cinnamon, allspice, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes until flavors meld.
11. **Add cheese**: Remove from heat and stir in half the feta cheese and parsley.

### Stuff and Bake
12. **Fill shells**: Divide the meat mixture among the eggplant shells, mounding it slightly.
13. **Top with cheese**: Sprinkle remaining feta and Parmesan cheese over the tops.
14. **Final bake**: Return to oven and bake for 15-20 minutes until cheese is golden and filling is heated through.

### Serve
15. **Garnish**: Sprinkle with remaining parsley and pine nuts if using.
16. **Serve**: Serve hot as a complete meal.

## Keto Tips

- **Meat options**: Ground turkey or chicken work well too, though lamb gives the most authentic flavor
- **Cheese variations**: Try goat cheese or ricotta instead of feta
- **Extra vegetables**: Add diced bell peppers or zucchini to the filling

## Make-Ahead Tips

- **Prep ahead**: Eggplant shells and filling can be prepared up to 2 days in advance
- **Freeze**: Assembled stuffed eggplants freeze well for up to 3 months
- **Reheat**: Cover with foil and reheat at 350°F until warmed through
