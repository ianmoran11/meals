# Mediterranean Roasted Vegetable Medley

This vibrant medley of roasted vegetables brings together the best of Mediterranean flavors. Perfect as a side dish or a light main course, these vegetables are roasted until caramelized and tender, then finished with feta and fresh herbs.

## Ingredients

- 1 medium eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 2 medium zucchini, sliced into half-moons
- 1 red bell pepper, cut into chunks
- 1 yellow bell pepper, cut into chunks
- 1 red onion, cut into wedges
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and left whole
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

## Instructions

### Prepare the Vegetables
1. **Preheat oven**: Set to 425°F (220°C).
2. **Cut vegetables**: Prepare all vegetables, keeping pieces roughly the same size for even cooking.
3. **Pat dry**: If eggplant releases moisture after cutting, pat dry with paper towels.

### Season and Roast
4. **Mix seasonings**: In a small bowl, combine oregano, thyme, rosemary, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.
5. **Toss vegetables**: In a large bowl, toss all vegetables with olive oil and the herb mixture until evenly coated.
6. **Arrange on pan**: Spread vegetables in a single layer on two large baking sheets. Don't overcrowd - this ensures proper roasting.
7. **Roast**: Bake for 25-30 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until vegetables are tender and edges are caramelized.

### Finish and Serve
8. **Add finishing touches**: Remove from oven and immediately drizzle with lemon juice.
9. **Add cheese**: Sprinkle crumbled feta over the hot vegetables.
10. **Garnish**: Top with fresh parsley and serve warm.

## Serving Suggestions

- **As a side**: Perfect alongside grilled meats or fish
- **Main dish**: Serve over cauliflower rice or with a dollop of Greek yogurt
- **Meal prep**: Great for batch cooking and reheating throughout the week

## Keto Tips

- **Lower carbs**: Reduce or omit tomatoes and bell peppers for fewer carbs
- **Add protein**: Top with grilled chicken, lamb, or chickpeas (if carbs allow)
- **Extra fats**: Drizzle with additional olive oil or add olives

## Variations

- **Spicy version**: Add red pepper flakes or harissa paste
- **Different herbs**: Try fresh basil, mint, or dill instead of parsley
- **Cheese options**: Use goat cheese or skip for dairy-free

## Storage Tips

- **Refrigerate**: Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days
- **Reheat**: Warm in oven at 350°F or enjoy cold in salads
- **Freeze**: Can be frozen for up to 2 months
