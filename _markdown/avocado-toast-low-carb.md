---

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Toast the low-carb bread</strong> until golden and crisp</li>
<li><strong>Slice the avocado</strong> in half, remove the pit, and gently scoop out the flesh</li>
<li><strong>Mash the avocado</strong> directly on the toast with a fork, leaving some chunks for texture</li>
<li><strong>Drizzle with olive oil</strong> generously</li>
<li><strong>Season</strong> with sea salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes if using</li>
<li><strong>Serve immediately</strong> while the toast is still warm</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>For an extra Mediterranean touch, rub the toast with a garlic clove before adding avocado</li>
<li>Add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to prevent browning</li>
<li>Best served immediately when the bread is still crispy</li>
</ul>
