# Greek-Style Keto Chicken Souvlaki with Tzatziki

These authentic Greek chicken skewers are marinated in olive oil, lemon, and herbs, then grilled to perfection. Served with homemade tzatziki, it's a satisfying keto-friendly meal that brings the flavors of Greece to your table.

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken Souvlaki
- 2 pounds boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch chunks
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

### For the Tzatziki
- 1 cup Greek yogurt (full-fat)
- 1 medium cucumber, grated and drained
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped (or 1 tsp dried)
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt to taste

### For Serving
- Lemon wedges
- Fresh herbs for garnish

## Instructions

### Prepare the Tzatziki (Make First)
1. **Drain cucumber**: Grate cucumber and place in a fine-mesh strainer. Sprinkle with salt and let drain for 15 minutes, then squeeze out excess water with paper towels.
2. **Mix tzatziki**: In a bowl, combine Greek yogurt, drained cucumber, minced garlic, dill, lemon juice, and olive oil. Season with salt to taste.
3. **Chill**: Refrigerate while preparing chicken to let flavors meld.

### Marinate the Chicken
4. **Make marinade**: In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper.
5. **Marinate chicken**: Add chicken chunks to marinade and toss to coat. Let marinate for at least 15 minutes (or up to 4 hours in refrigerator).

### Cook the Souvlaki
6. **Prepare skewers**: Thread marinated chicken onto metal or soaked wooden skewers, leaving small gaps between pieces.
7. **Heat grill or pan**: Preheat grill to medium-high heat, or heat a grill pan over medium-high heat.
8. **Cook chicken**: Grill skewers for 12-15 minutes, turning every 3-4 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and slightly charred (internal temperature 165°F/74°C).

### Serve
9. **Rest**: Let chicken rest for 2-3 minutes after cooking.
10. **Serve**: Serve hot with tzatziki sauce and lemon wedges. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.

## Keto Tips

- **Serve with**: Instead of pita, serve over a Greek salad with cucumber, tomatoes, olives, and feta
- **Make ahead**: Both the marinade and tzatziki can be prepared a day ahead
- **Vegetable sides**: Pair with grilled zucchini, eggplant, or bell peppers

## Convenience Hacks

- **Quick marinade**: Even 15 minutes of marinating makes a difference
- **Batch cooking**: Double the recipe and freeze half the marinated chicken for later
- **Indoor cooking**: These work great in a cast iron pan if you don't have a grill
