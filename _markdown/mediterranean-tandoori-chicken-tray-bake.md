# Mediterranean Tandoori Chicken Tray Bake

This sheet pan dinner brings together the bold flavors of tandoori spices with fresh Mediterranean vegetables for an effortless low-carb meal. Using jarred tandoori paste makes this incredibly convenient while still delivering authentic taste.

## Ingredients

- 4 boneless chicken thighs (or breasts, skin-on or skinless)
- 3 tablespoons tandoori paste (from a jar - I recommend Patak's or similar)
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1 medium zucchini, cut into thick rounds
- 1 red bell pepper, cut into large chunks
- 1 cup cauliflower florets (or use broccoli)
- 1 red onion, cut into wedges
- 8-10 cherry tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)
- Lemon wedges (for serving)

## Instructions

### Marinate (Optional - 5 mins or overnight)
1. **Mix the marinade**: In a large bowl, combine tandoori paste and Greek yogurt. This creates a creamy marinade that keeps the chicken incredibly moist.
2. **Season chicken**: Pat chicken dry and coat with the tandoori yogurt mixture. For best results, marinate 30 minutes or overnight, but even 5-10 minutes works for busy nights.

### Prepare the Tray
3. **Preheat oven**: Set to 425째F (220째C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
4. **Season vegetables**: In a large bowl, toss zucchini, bell pepper, cauliflower, and onion with olive oil, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper.
5. **Arrange on tray**: Spread vegetables in a single layer on one side of the baking sheet.
6. **Add chicken**: Place marinated chicken pieces skin-side up (if using skin-on) among the vegetables. Spoon any extra marinade over the chicken.
7. **Add tomatoes**: Scatter cherry tomatoes over the vegetables - they'll roast beautifully and add juicy bursts.

### Bake
8. **First bake**: Roast for 20 minutes. The high heat helps caramelize the vegetables and creates that lovely char on the chicken.
9. **Toss and finish**: Toss vegetables gently, then return to oven for 10-15 minutes more, until chicken reaches 165째F (74째C) internal temperature and vegetables are tender.

### Serve
10. **Garnish**: Remove from oven and let rest 5 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh cilantro.
11. **Serve**: Serve with extra lemon wedges for squeezing over the top. The charred edges and creamy yogurt-marinated chicken make this incredibly satisfying.

## Low-Carb Tips

- **Vegetable swaps**: Feel free to swap in eggplant cubes, bell peppers, or mushrooms - all are low-carb friendly
- **Serve over**: Instead of rice, try serving over cauliflower rice or with a simple green salad
- **Leftovers**: This reheats beautifully and works great for meal prep

## Convenience Hacks

- **Prep ahead**: The vegetables can be prepped up to 2 days ahead
- **Marinade shortcut**: If you're really pressed for time, just brush the chicken with tandoori paste straight from the jar - still delicious!
- **Double batch**: Make twice as much and use leftovers in salads or wraps
