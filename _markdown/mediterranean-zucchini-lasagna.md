# Mediterranean Zucchini Lasagna

This keto-friendly lasagna replaces traditional pasta with thin zucchini slices, creating layers of Mediterranean flavors with seasoned meat sauce and creamy cheeses. It's a satisfying comfort food that keeps carbs low.

## Ingredients

### For the Zucchini Layers
- 3 large zucchini, sliced lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips
- 1 teaspoon salt (for draining zucchini)

### For the Meat Sauce
- 1 pound ground lamb or beef
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

### For the Cheese Layer
- 2 cups ricotta cheese
- 1 egg
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated
- Fresh basil for garnish

## Instructions

### Prepare the Zucchini
1. **Slice zucchini**: Using a mandoline or sharp knife, slice zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch strips.
2. **Salt and drain**: Lay zucchini slices on paper towels, sprinkle with salt, and let sit for 20 minutes to draw out moisture.
3. **Pat dry**: Blot zucchini slices thoroughly with paper towels to remove excess moisture.

### Make the Meat Sauce
4. **Cook aromatics**: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened.
5. **Add garlic**: Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
6. **Brown meat**: Add ground lamb or beef and cook, breaking it up, until browned (about 8 minutes).
7. **Add tomatoes**: Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, and cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper.
8. **Simmer**: Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes until sauce thickens.

### Prepare the Cheese Mixture
9. **Mix cheeses**: In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, and half the mozzarella. Mix well and season with salt and pepper.

### Assemble the Lasagna
10. **Preheat oven**: Set to 375°F (190°C).
11. **Layer ingredients**: In a 9x13 inch baking dish:
    - Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom
    - Add a layer of zucchini slices
    - Spread half the ricotta mixture
    - Add half the remaining meat sauce
    - Repeat layers once more
    - Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese

### Bake
12. **Cover and bake**: Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
13. **Uncover and brown**: Remove foil and bake for 15 minutes more until cheese is golden and bubbly.
14. **Rest**: Let lasagna rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow it to set.

### Serve
15. **Garnish and serve**: Garnish with fresh basil and serve hot.
