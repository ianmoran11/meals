# Mediterranean Herb-Crusted Salmon with Roasted Vegetables

This vibrant dish combines tender salmon with a Mediterranean herb crust and a colorful array of roasted vegetables. It's a perfect keto-friendly meal that's both satisfying and nutritious.

## Ingredients

- 4 salmon fillets (6 oz each, skin-on or skinless)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 medium zucchini, sliced into half-moons
- 1 medium yellow squash, sliced into half-moons
- 1 red bell pepper, cut into strips
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes
- 1 small red onion, sliced
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

### Prepare the Herb Crust
1. **Preheat oven**: Set to 425°F (220°C).
2. **Mix herbs**: In a small bowl, combine oregano, thyme, garlic powder, and lemon zest.
3. **Prepare salmon**: Pat salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Brush the top of each fillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
4. **Apply crust**: Sprinkle the herb mixture evenly over the top of each fillet, then top with grated Parmesan cheese.

### Prepare the Vegetables
5. **Chop vegetables**: Slice zucchini, yellow squash, and red onion. Cut red bell pepper into strips.
6. **Season vegetables**: In a large bowl, toss all vegetables with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper.

### Bake
7. **Arrange on tray**: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Arrange seasoned vegetables in a single layer on one side of the sheet. Place salmon fillets on the other side, crust-side up.
8. **Roast**: Bake for 12-15 minutes until salmon is cooked through and vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.

### Serve
9. **Garnish**: Remove from oven and let rest for 2-3 minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley.
10. **Serve**: Serve immediately while hot.

## Keto Tips

- **Vegetable swaps**: Feel free to substitute with other low-carb vegetables like broccoli, asparagus, or eggplant
- **Cheese options**: Try swapping Parmesan with feta or omit for dairy-free
- **Extra fat**: Drizzle with additional olive oil or add a pat of butter on each salmon fillet before serving
