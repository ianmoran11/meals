### For the Bowl

## Instructions

### Prepare the Shrimp
1. **Marinate shrimp**: In a bowl, combine shrimp with olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper. Let marinate for 10 minutes.
2. **Heat pan**: Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.
3. **Cook shrimp**: Cook shrimp for 2-3 minutes per side until pink and cooked through. Remove from heat and set aside.

### Make the Cauliflower Rice
4. **Rice cauliflower**: If using fresh cauliflower, pulse florets in a food processor until they resemble rice grains.
5. **Cook cauliflower**: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
6. **Add cauliflower**: Add riced cauliflower to the pan and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until tender. Season with salt and pepper.

### Prepare the Vegetables
7. **Prep vegetables**: While cauliflower cooks, prepare cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion.
8. **Season vegetables**: In a bowl, toss the prepared vegetables with lemon juice and a pinch of salt.

### Assemble the Bowls
9. **Build bowls**: Divide cauliflower rice among 4 bowls. Top each with grilled shrimp.
10. **Add toppings**: Arrange seasoned vegetables, olives, and feta cheese around each bowl.
11. **Garnish**: Sprinkle with fresh parsley and mint. Serve with lemon wedges.

## Keto Tips

- **Make ahead**: Cauliflower rice can be prepared up to 3 days in advance
- **Protein swaps**: Try with grilled chicken, salmon, or lamb for variety
- **Extra fats**: Drizzle with extra olive oil or add avocado slices

## Convenience Hacks

- **Pre-riced cauliflower**: Save time by using store-bought riced cauliflower
- **Batch prep**: Cook extra shrimp and cauliflower rice for easy meal prep
- **Frozen shrimp**: Thaw frozen shrimp quickly under cold running water

## Storage Tips

- **Refrigerate**: Store components separately for up to 3 days
- **Reheat**: Gently reheat cauliflower rice and shrimp, add fresh vegetables when serving
